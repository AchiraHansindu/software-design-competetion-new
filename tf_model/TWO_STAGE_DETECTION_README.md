# Two-Stage Transformer Defect Detection System

## üéØ Overview

This system performs **two-stage detection** for transformer defect analysis:

1. **Stage 1**: Segment and locate the transformer in thermal images
2. **Stage 2**: Detect and classify defects within the segmented transformer region

The system can detect **6 types of transformer defects**:
- Full Wire Overload PF
- Loose Joint F
- Loose Joint PF  
- Point Overload F
- Point Overload PF
- Transformer Overload

## üìä Expected Results

### Stage 1: Transformer Detection
- **Input**: Original thermal image
- **Output**: Bounding box around transformer
- **Confidence**: Typically 0.90-0.99 for clear images

### Stage 2: Defect Detection  
- **Input**: Cropped transformer region
- **Output**: Defects with bounding boxes and classifications
- **Classes**: 6 defect types with confidence scores

### Final Output
- **Annotated Image**: Original image with transformer and defect overlays
- **Detailed Visualization**: Multi-panel view showing all stages
- **JSON Report**: Complete detection results and metadata

## üé® Output Examples

### Files Generated
For input image `transformer_001.jpg`, the system generates:
- `transformer_001_annotated_20251004_175813.jpg` - Final annotated result
- `transformer_001_detailed_20251004_175813.png` - Detailed visualization  
- `transformer_001_report_20251004_175813.json` - Complete detection report

### Visual Results
- **Cyan Box**: Transformer location (Stage 1)
- **Colored Boxes**: Defects with class labels and confidence scores
- **Color Coding**: Each defect type has a unique color

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Confidence Thresholds
- **0.3-0.4**: More sensitive, detects more potential defects
- **0.5**: Balanced (default)
- **0.6-0.8**: More conservative, only high-confidence detections

### Model Paths
Update model paths in the script if using custom trained models:
```python
detector = TwoStageDefectDetector(
    transformer_model_path="custom/transformer/model.pt",
    defect_model_path="custom/defect/model.pt"
)
```

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Transformer Segmentation (Stage 1)
- **Accuracy**: ~95% detection rate on thermal images
- **Speed**: ~50ms per image on RTX 5060

### Defect Detection (Stage 2)  
- **mAP@0.5**: 0.465 (46.5% overall accuracy)
- **Best Classes**: 
  - Transformer Overload: 99.5% mAP
  - Loose Joint PF: 99.5% mAP
- **Speed**: ~100ms per cropped transformer region

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Model Not Found
```
‚ùå Transformer model not found: runs/seg_y11n_tx3/weights/best.pt
```
**Solution**: Ensure transformer segmentation training is completed first

#### Environment Issues
```
‚ùå Import "ultralytics" could not be resolved
```
**Solution**: Activate conda environment: `conda activate yolov11`

#### No Transformer Detected
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Status: no_transformer_detected
```
**Solutions**:
- Lower confidence threshold (`--confidence 0.3`)
- Check image quality and lighting
- Ensure image contains visible transformer

#### Poor Defect Detection
**Solutions**:
- Adjust confidence threshold
- Verify image is thermal (not RGB)
- Check if defects are clearly visible in thermal spectrum

### Performance Optimization

#### For Faster Processing
- Use smaller image sizes (resize to 640x640)
- Increase confidence threshold
- Use GPU acceleration

#### For Better Accuracy  
- Use higher resolution images
- Lower confidence threshold
- Ensemble multiple model predictions

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

### Adding New Defect Classes
1. Update `defect_classes` list in `TwoStageDefectDetector`
2. Add corresponding colors in `colors` dictionary
3. Retrain defect detection model with new classes

### Custom Model Integration
```python
# Replace model paths
detector = TwoStageDefectDetector(
    transformer_model_path="your_transformer_model.pt",
    defect_model_path="your_defect_model.pt"
)
```

### Extending Functionality
- Add preprocessing filters for image enhancement
- Implement post-processing for result refinement
- Add export capabilities (PDF reports, Excel summaries)

## üìã System Requirements

### Hardware
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX series (recommended) or CPU
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB for models and results
